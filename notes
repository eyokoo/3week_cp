to create a TABLE

CREATE TABLE users (
  _id number,
  name varchar,
  occupation varchar,
  is_active boolean

);

-- you can comment your sql script using --

-- in sql a javascript string is equivalent 
-- to a sql VARCHAR (varrying characters)

-- in sql we use single quotes for strings/varchars, not double quotes


-- to add a record 
INSERT INTO users VALUES(1, 'Mike', 'Developer', 1);

-- to fetch all the records and all the columns
SELECT * FROM users;

-- to fetch some of the columns you can specify them in the select clause
SELECT name, occupation FROM users;

-- to fetch some of the rows but not all
-- add a where clause to limit the DataCue

-- this will return all active users
SELECT * FROM users where is_active = 1;

-- this will return all users with id 2
SELECT * FROM users where _id = 2;

--you can combine limiting rows and columns in the query
-- fetch the names of the active users
SELECT name FROM users WHERE is_active = 1;


-- to delete a users
DELETE FROM users WHERE _id = 1;

-- to delete all not active users
DELETE FROM users WHERE is_active =0;


-- WHERE clause is used to limit records/rows
-- where clause can match on multiple criteria
 
-- fetch users that are active and are developers
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE is_active =1 AND occupation = 'Developer'


-- fetch usrs that are bakers and have an id > 20
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE occupation = 'Baker' AND _id > 20;

-- fetch users that are either bakers or (developer with id >20)
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE occupation = 'Baker' OR (occupation = 'Developer' AND _id >20)
